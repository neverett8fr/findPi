# findPi
This is to find the value of Pi by plotting random points, I think this is a classic interview question, also ew Python.

#Maths Used:
##Pythagorus law - a^2 + b^2 = c^2
##A = (Pi)r^2
##(Pi) = A/(r^2)
###A = Total points plotted, (r^2) = Total points within circle, total points less than one when doing Pythagorus law

### not sure if explained it well but you should be able to work it outtttt.
