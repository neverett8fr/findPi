# findPi
This is to find the value of Pi by plotting random points, I think this is a classic interview question.

# Maths Used:
## Pythagorus law: a^2 + b^2 = c^2
## A = (Pi)r^2
## (Pi) = A/(r^2)
  
# Final Maths:
## (count[All plotted points within a circle] / count[All points total]) * 4

### not sure if explained it well but you should be able to work it outtttt.
